# Introduction

*Kotlin Guide - Mobile Application Secure Coding Practices*, is a guide written
for anyone using [Kotlin][1] for mobile development.

This book is a collaborative effort started by [Checkmarx Security Research
Team][2], open sourced for community contributions. Its structure covers the
[OWASP Mobile Top 10 2016][3] intended to help developers avoid common mistakes.

Kotlin is a _statically typed programming language for modern multiplatform
applications 100% interoperable with Java™ and Android™_, primarily developed
by the team at [JetBrains][4]. It is now fully supported by Google as an
alternative to the Android standard Java compiler.

## Why This Book

Since May 7th 2019, Kotlin is Google's preferred language for Android app
development. So, it is important for developers to familiarize with this new
language.

Checkmarx Research Team helps educate developers, security teams, and the
industry overall about common coding errors, and brings awareness of
vulnerabilities that are often introduced during the software development
process.

## The Audience for this Book

The primary audience of this guide is Android developers. This guide can still
be used by penetration testers to learn how to identify well-known
vulnerabilities on Kotlin applications.

## What You Will Learn

The authors of this book mapped the OWASP Mobile Top 10 security weaknesses to
Kotlin on a weakness-by-weakness basis while providing examples,
recommendations, and fixes to help developers avoid common mistakes and
pitfalls. After reading this book and referring to it often, you will learn how
to ensure you are developing secure mobile apps using Kotlin.
