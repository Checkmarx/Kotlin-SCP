Final Notes
===========

The Checkmarx Research team is confident that this Kotlin Secure Coding
Practices guide provided value to you. We encourage you to refer to it often, as
you're developing Android apps written in Kotlin. The information found in this
guide can help you develop more-secure apps and avoid the common mistakes and
pitfalls that lead to vulnerable applications. Understanding that exploitation
techniques are always evolving, new vulnerabilities might be found in the
future, based on dependencies that may make your application vulnerable.
